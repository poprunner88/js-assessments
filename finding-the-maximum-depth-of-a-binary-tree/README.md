# Finding the maximum depth of a binary tree

The maximum depth of a binary tree is the number of nodes from the root down to the furthest leaf node. In other words, it is the height of a binary tree.

## Input

```console
1, 2, 3, 4, -1, 5, 6, -1, -1, -1, -1, 7, 8, -1, 9, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, 10, -1, -1, -1, 11, -1
```

Above array means below binary tree. An empty node is displayed as `-1`.

```console
    1
   / \
  2   3
 /   / \
4   5   6
   / \   \
  7   8   9
     /   /
    10  11
```

## Output

```console

```

## Execute

```bash
node solution.js
```
